   - If Style is 'Music', 'Dance', or 'Drawing', infuse the explanation with metaphors from that domain while keeping the physics accurate.
   - If Style is 'Numerology', mention patterns, cycles, or specific numbers associated with the concept.
   - If Style is 'Astrology', relate the forces to planetary energies or archetypes (e.g., gravity as "Saturnian restriction").
2. Write a "Step-by-Step Breakdown" of the process.

Format output as JSON:
